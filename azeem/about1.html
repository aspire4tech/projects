        <h2>3. üåç Habitats & lifestyle</h2>
        <p>
          Every animal lives in a specific type of environment called a habitat, and their way of living is known as their lifestyle. <br>These two things are closely connected, as animals adapt their behaviors, body features, and survival methods based on where they live.
           <br> There are many different types of habitats, such as:
            <br>Forests ‚Äì Home to wild animals like tigers, elephants, monkeys, and deer.

        <h2>4. üö® Endangered species</h2>
        <p>
          Endangered species are animals that are at risk of disappearing from the Earth forever. These species have very small populations left and may soon become extinct if we don‚Äôt take steps to protect them.<br>
                There are many reasons why animals become endangered:
                <br>Habitat loss ‚Äì when forests and natural areas are destroyed by humans
               <br> Hunting and poaching ‚Äì illegal killing of animals for skin, bones, horns, etc.
                <br>Pollution ‚Äì chemicals in air, water, or land harm animal life
                <br>Climate change ‚Äì rising temperatures and changing weather affect animal survival
                <br>Loss of food ‚Äì when animals can't find enough to eat due to changes in nature
