        <h2> 1. 🐾 About Animals</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
            Animals are an important part of our environment. <br>Every animal has its own role – some are kings of the jungle, while others are man’s best friends. <br>Some animals are pets that live in homes, and some are wild animals that live naturally in forests.

        <h2>2. 🐘 Animal categories</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
          Animals are found all over the world, and they can be grouped into different categories based on their habitat, behavior, and relationship with humans. <br>Understanding these categories helps us learn more about how animals live and survive in their environments.
          <br>Here are the main categories of <br>
        Wild Animals – These animals live in forests, jungles, mountains, or deserts. <br>They are not tamed and survive on their own in nature. <br> Examples: Lion, Tiger, Elephant, Leopard. <br>
        Domestic Animals – These are animals that live with or around humans. <br>They are often used for farming, transport, or companionship. <br>Examples: Cow, Horse, Goat, Buffalo.<br>
        Pet Animals – These are animals kept at home for companionship and affection. <br>Examples: Dog, Cat, Rabbit, Parrot.

        <h2>3. 🌍 Habitats & lifestyle</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
          Every animal lives in a specific type of environment called a habitat, and their way of living is known as their lifestyle. <br>These two things are closely connected, as animals adapt their behaviors, body features, and survival methods based on where they live.
           <br> There are many different types of habitats, such as:
            <br>Forests – Home to wild animals like tigers, elephants, monkeys, and deer.
            <br>Deserts – Hot and dry areas where animals like camels, snakes, and lizards live.
            <br>Oceans & Rivers – Aquatic habitats for creatures like fish, whales, dolphins, and crabs.
            <br>Mountains – Cold, rocky places where animals like snow leopards, yaks, and mountain goats survive.

        <h2>4. 🚨 Endangered species</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
          Endangered species are animals that are at risk of disappearing from the Earth forever. These species have very small populations left and may soon become extinct if we don’t take steps to protect them.<br>
                There are many reasons why animals become endangered:
                <br>Habitat loss – when forests and natural areas are destroyed by humans
               <br> Hunting and poaching – illegal killing of animals for skin, bones, horns, etc.
                <br>Pollution – chemicals in air, water, or land harm animal life
                <br>Climate change – rising temperatures and changing weather affect animal survival
                <br>Loss of food – when animals can't find enough to eat due to changes in nature

        <h2>7.🌱 Importance of Animals in Ecosystems</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
          
Animals play a major role in keeping nature balanced. <br>Bees help in pollination, earthworms enrich the soil, predators like lions control prey populations, and scavengers like vultures clean up dead matter. Without animals, our ecosystem would fall apart. <br>This section explains how every animal, big or small, has a role to play in keeping the Earth alive and healthy.
